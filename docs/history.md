# <u>**History**</u>
Progress was slow during the beginning of the year. We didn't have a mat to practice on so while we waited for our coach to get one we slowly built our robots. 

We did get a mat however school got quite busy this year with both of use being in the senior grades. We both just started with experimenting with our respective platforms(Michael worked on the Arduino bot while I used EV3). The EV3 is still incomplete however Michael's bot shows promise. There were a few mishaps like the motor driver board dying. Initially Michael used 3 [Arduino Nanos](/docs/parts.md#arduino-nano) as our control and logic boards however they did not meet the processing requirements. Later on an [Esp 32 camera](/docs/parts.md#esp-32-cam) board was added for the obstacle challenge. At some point our gyro board(Which we changed to a [Pi Pico](/docs/parts.md#pi-pico)) died and had to be replaced. There was also issues with powering the robot from the initial 3 cell Li-ion battery. Currently we use a 6 cell battery with voltage regulators. We had fun and hope to score well as we only have 1 and 2 chances to enter into WRO competitions in the future. 


the address of the motor board is 13.
lidar is 11
gyro is 12
